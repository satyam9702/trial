# Advanced Scientific Calculator

This project is a modern scientific calculator web application featuring advanced mathematical functions, persistent history, keyboard support, and memory operations. The interface is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- üî¢ Basic arithmetic with parentheses, exponentiation, and percentage handling
- üßÆ Scientific functions: trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic (log/ln), square and cube roots, absolute value, exponential, and factorial
- üìê Radian/Degree toggle that automatically adapts trigonometric calculations
- üß† Memory operations (MC, MR, M+, M‚àí) with live indicator
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Calculation history that can be recalled with a single click
- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard input support for faster entry
- üì± Responsive design with glassmorphism-inspired styling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (none required‚Äîpure HTML/CSS/JS).
2. Start a simple HTTP server, for example:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and navigate to `index.html`.

## Deployment

You can deploy the calculator using GitHub Pages:

1. Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
2. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose the `main` branch as the source.
3. Your calculator will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.
